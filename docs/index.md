# A Brief Guide to [**Vizome**](http://www.vizome.org)

![vizome_main](img/vizome_main.png)

Vizome is an interactive, context-aware knowledge discovery platform created by Libbey White, Beth Wilmot, Dan Bottomly, and Shannon McWeeney at Oregon Health & Science University.

The two datasets currently available in Vizome are [Beat AML](http://vizome.org/aml/) ([Tyner et al., *Nature* 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0623-z)) and [Crenolanib](http://vizome.org/crenolanib/) ([Zhang et al., *Nat Commun.* 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08263-x)). 

The links in this documentation point to the Beat AML Vizome, but the information is similar for Crenolanib.

Much of this documentation can also be found in Vizome by clicking the ![info_button](img/info_button.jpg) button on each page.
